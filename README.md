# Education

### New York University Abu Dhabi
- B.S., Mathematics & CS (_May 2028_)


# Work Experience
### Summer Research Assistant @ Engineering Design Studio (_May 2023 - July 2023_)
- Collaborated with JPL engineerings from Group 335A (Architecture and Formulation Group) to design and deliver a novel, flight-ready Hold-Down-and-Release Mechanism (HDRM) 
- Designed and launched a reusable experimental sounding rocket at Spaceport America Cup 2023
- Engineered custom PCBs (Power Distribution and Flight Controller) and designed corresponding Embedded Systems
- Manufactured dynamic and structural 3D printed/ CNC Machined components for the experimental sounding rocket

# Projects
### NASA-JPL University Crowdsourcing Initiative (JUCI) (_Sep 2022 - June 2023_)
**CAD, Stress Simulations**
- Delivered a Hold-Down-and-Release-Mechanism (HDRM) for CubeSats and small space missions
- Reduced system costs by 90% (approximately $10,000 > $1,000) while maintaining NASA Flight Requirements
